# LSB-STEGANOGRAPHY-C
I have developed an LSB Steganography project in C that securely hides secret text messages inside a .bmp image file. The encoding process starts with the user selecting a .txt file containing the message and providing a password for security. During encoding, the program first stores the password length, followed by the password itself, then the file extension and its length, and finally the actual secret message. This ensures that during decoding, the program can extract the stored password to verify the user. If the entered password matches, it retrieves the file extension and the hidden message, restoring the original file with the correct extension. If the password is incorrect, access to the message is denied. This method ensures that the hidden data remains secure and can be accurately reconstructed after decoding.
